# Introduction

Thanks for considering contributing to Kee. It's people like you that help Kee to continually improve.

Kee is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, translating Kee into more languages, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the next version of Kee.

# Ground Rules

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

In particular, if you are considering searching or asking for help about any of the following you should go to the [forum](https://forum.kee.pm).

* Help using Kee
* Documentation

# Translating

Most of Kee can be translated into any language. If you want to help users to understand Kee it would be great if you could translate the English version into your own language. Several languages are already complete but there are hundreds still awaiting translation so please take a look.

The best way for you to get started is to log in (or click the link to sign up) here: https://www.transifex.com/signin/

Once you're logged in to Transifex you should see an option to join the team for your language in the Kee project: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/keefox/

# Testing

Kee is primarilly an integration product - it's value, and the outcomes one wants to test, come from the combination of mutliple products. The best value tests are therefore those which excersise this entire user experience. Currently this is done manually before a release by working through the Kee tutorial and exploring a random selection of websites looking for unusual behaviour.

There would be a benefit from the development of some automated testing in this area (utilising something like Selenium perhaps) and also probably some more focussed unit testing around areas relating to data transfer with KeePassRPC and maybe logic around form detection (taking inputs such as a mock DOM, JSON config and list of matched entries).

None of this work is currently planned so if this is an area that interests you, please get involved to help keep the quality of Kee improving.

# Development

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

More information about developing for Kee is coming soon. In the mean time, the build instructions in the [README](https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon/blob/master/README.md) will have to suffice.

# GitHub issues

GitHub issues are for clear and well defined changes to project behaviour, appearance and code. This allows Kee developers to keep track of planned feature development, bug fixes and other tasks.

Issues may not always be worked on immediately but if there is not a clear plan and need for a change, the issue may be closed, at least until the need or specification is more clearly evaluated on the community forum.

Each issue can have one or more labels attached. "**enhancement**", "**bug**" and "**task**" should be self-explanatory; others are explained in sections below.

## Closed issues

A closed issue with no label other than the three mentioned above is considered "finished" - it has been implemented, tested and released (or will be released with the next version of Kee). That doesn't mean there are no bugs but normally we'd create a new issue for a bug associated with a "finished" issue.

Other reasons for an issue to be closed are:

"**invalid**" - This could mean many things. E.g. it's not a real bug or enhancement request, there is not enough information to define the issue well enough to act upon it, other changes have made it obsolete, etc.

"**wontfix**" - For some reason (usually explained in the issue comments) we've decided to not implement the change requested in this issue. Such a state is not a permanent ban on the enhancement or bug fix but it's a good indication that we don't feel that our limited development time should be spent on this particular issue in the foreseeable future.

"**duplicate**" - The underlying request or problem is already covered by an existing issue.

## Open issues

An open issue is one that we have not yet had time to implement. For new issues it's possible that we've just not yet had time to assess the issue and make a decision about how to procede.

You can see what each developer is working on by looking at the issues that are assigned to them. Depending on the scope of the issue, a developer may be working on it for hours, days or even months.

Open issues may be "**blocked**" which indicates that we are unable to proceed with the issue. The reason will usually be described in a comment. A common reason would be when we are depenendant upon a change being made to other software (e.g. Firefox).

### Milestones

Each open issue may have a milestone attached to it. These give an indication (but by no means a guarantee) of when we expect a particular issue to be finished.

If there is no milestone this implies that either:

1. the issue is clear and well understood but we have not decided when it will be implemented
2. we may implement the feature one day but a major concern is keeping us from committing to it at the moment (e.g. unclear security or privacy implications, limitations of current technology, size of task makes it unlikely we could find time to implement it, etc.)

Issues that remain in the 2nd state for any significant length of time are likely to be closed as invalid or wontfix.

Note that in contrast to the KeeFox project, we prefer lengthy discussion and "wouldn't it be nice if..." ideas to remain on the community forum until there is a reasonable chance that someone will be able to work on the issue. There will always be grey areas though so don't read into the presense of a GitHub issue too rigidly.
